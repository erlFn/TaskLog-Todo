# Welcome Page Setup

- [] Must contain a button that can, or will redirect to `Login Page`, or `Register Page`.
- [] If a user isn't authenticated yet, the `Login Page`, and `Register Page` button will be shown.
- [] If a user is already authenticated, there will be a button that will redirect to `Dashboard Page`.

<!-- Basically the Login, and Register button will not be shown if the user is already authenticated, and vice-versa -->
